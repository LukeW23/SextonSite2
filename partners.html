Make-A-Wish Ireland has one simple aim – to grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions, to bring hope, strength and happiness. 
<br><br>
Since 1992, Make-A-Wish has granted wishes for more than 2,900 brave children across Ireland, including 183 wishes granted in 2022 alone. A wish granted is true magic for the child, providing respite from their normal routines of hospitals, doctors and treatment. Make-A-Wish does not receive any government funding and relies overwhelmingly on the kindness of the Irish public to continue granting wishes. 
<br><br>
As a well-respected and popular children’s charity, Make-A-Wish is fully committed to providing the maximum level of care and enjoyment for our children and their families. This is achieved through a combination of professionalism, attention to detail and sensitivity. Nothing is too much trouble for a wish child.
<br><br>
In all possible cases, Make-A-Wish ensures that all immediate family members can participate in the child’s wish. In doing so the family can create lasting, happy memories.
<br><br>
Make-A-Wish Ireland is ‘triple locked’ by Charities Institute Ireland for best practice in transparency and accountability.
